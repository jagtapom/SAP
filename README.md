We propose the implementation of an Agentic AI Workflow Framework to automate and optimize multiple stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and other complex enterprise workflows. This framework will leverage a system of autonomous, specialized AI agents, coordinated with a human-in-the-loop model to maintain oversight, ensure compliance, and guarantee quality assurance throughout the process.
The solution is designed to ingest requirement documents, existing codebases, and system metadata, transforming them through automated workflows that improve efficiency and reduce manual effort. The key capabilities of the framework include:
•	Automated User Story Generation from functional requirements.
•	Intelligent Document Generation, including architecture diagrams, technical specifications, and compliance documents.
•	API Specification and Code Generation, aligned with development standards and security policies.
•	Automated Impact Analysis across existing codebases and dependencies.
•	Test Case Generation and Validation, ensuring comprehensive and automated test coverage.
•	End-to-End Deployment Support to accelerate the overall time to market.
This AI-driven approach is expected to deliver significant benefits:
•	Enhanced team productivity and engineering throughput.
•	Improved accuracy and reduced human errors in documentation and development.
•	Lower operational costs through automation of repetitive and resource-intensive tasks.
•	Faster iteration and delivery cycles, while maintaining regulatory compliance and risk management.
 
Scope of Implementation
1.	Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Automation
o	Automate the requirement-to-code pipelines using large language model (LLM)-driven agents.
o	Enable continuous impact analysis to identify potential risks in code changes and test coverage.
o	Facilitate the automated generation of API specifications and SDKs.
o	Integrate automation within DevSecOps pipelines to embed security and compliance from the ground up.
2.	Business Workflow Acceleration
o	IFRS 9 Reporting Automation
	End-to-end automation of data preparation, model validation, and reporting.
	Reduction in manual efforts while ensuring auditability and compliance with financial regulations.
o	Investment Banking & Corporate Banking
	Streamline processes like client onboarding, risk assessments, and compliance checks.
	Utilize AI agents to enhance reporting accuracy and operational efficiency.
3.	Knowledge Amplification & Risk Mitigation
o	Auto-generate living documentation that evolves with system and codebase changes.
o	Conduct proactive risk assessment and dependency impact analysis.
o	Institutionalize critical knowledge to reduce dependency on individual expertise and prevent knowledge loss.
4.	Intelligent Automation of Complex Engineering Tasks
o	Automate the generation and validation of architecture diagrams.
o	Implement automated code generation for reusable modules and system components.
o	Establish autonomous test case generation to ensure robust, end-to-end testing.
 
Expected Business Impact
•	Accelerated Time-to-Market: Shorten SDLC phases for faster product releases.

o	Focus on IFRS 9 reporting automation and SDLC acceleration.
•	Define KPIs to measure success:
o	Productivity gains
o	Operational cost reductions
o	Time-to-market improvements
o	Risk minimization
•	Architectural Design:
o	Develop a robust agentic workflow orchestration framework.
o	Integrate seamlessly with existing development, reporting, and business systems.
