Proposal
Implement an Agentic AI Workflow Framework to automate and streamline:

Multiple stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Other dynamic enterprise workflows

Leverage autonomous and specialized AI agents with a human-in-the-loop model for:

Oversight

Compliance

Quality assurance

Solution Capabilities
Ingests requirement documents, codebases, and system metadata to automate:

Automated User Story Generation from functional requirements

Intelligent Document Generation (architecture blueprints, technical specifications, compliance docs)

API Specification and Code Generation aligned with standards and security

Automated Impact Analysis on existing code and dependencies

Test Case Generation and Validation for comprehensive coverage

End-to-End Deployment Support to accelerate time to market

Expected Benefits:

Enhanced productivity

Improved accuracy

Reduced operational costs

Faster iteration cycles

Maintained compliance and risk oversight

Scope
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Automation

Automate requirement-to-code pipelines with LLM-driven agents

Enable continuous impact analysis for regression risks

Auto-generate API specifications and SDK scaffolding

Integrate with DevSecOps pipelines for secure, compliant development

Business Workflow Acceleration

Use Case 1: IFRS 9 Reporting Automation

Automate data preparation, model validation, and reporting workflows

Ensure auditability and regulatory compliance

Use Case 2: Investment & Corporate Banking

Streamline client onboarding, risk assessments, and compliance checks

Improve reporting accuracy and operational efficiency

Knowledge Amplification & Risk Mitigation

Auto-generate living documentation

Proactively conduct risk assessments and dependency analysis

Institutionalize knowledge to mitigate knowledge loss

Intelligent Automation of Complex Engineering Tasks

AI-driven architecture diagram generation and validation

Automated code generation for standardized modules

Comprehensive testing via autonomous test case generation

Business Impact
Time-to-Market Acceleration: Significantly shorten SDLC phases

Operational Cost Reduction: Minimize manual effort in development and compliance

Enhanced Accuracy: Lower human errors in complex, compliance-driven processes

Scalability: Replicable across various portfolios and banking domains

Strategic Advantage: Strengthens position in AI-driven digital transformation

Next Steps
Define Proof of Concept (PoC):

Focus on IFRS 9 Reporting Automation

Target SDLC automation

Establish KPIs:

Productivity gains

Cost savings

Time-to-market improvements

Risk reduction

Design Architecture:

Framework for agentic workflow orchestration

Seamless integration with existing development and business platforms
